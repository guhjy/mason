\title{Design the blueprint for an analysis.}
\usage{
design_analysis(data, test.type = c("gee", "cor", "glm", "pls", "plsda"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataset you want to analyze}

\item{test.type}{The type of statistical test to use}
}
\value{
Creates a blueprint object that will be used to construct the
  analysis in a later phase.
}
\description{
Sets up the initial design (i.e. the blueprint) of a statistical analysis to
use on the data. As in creating a building or structure, a blueprint is first
needed to guide the construction. This function \emph{only} creates that
blueprint, but does not do any construction (e.g. actually running statistics).

design(iris, 'gee')
